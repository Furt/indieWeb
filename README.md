#What is it?

indieWeb is a template that indie game makers can use to quickly get a game project website up and running.

## Setup

1. Fork the project.
2. Update the img and index.html.
3. Navigate to <username>.github.io/indieWeb/Index.html you should see your page

Note: There needs to be at least one push to trigger a page build. Otherwise you'll get a 404 see [StackOverflow Issue](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8587321/github-pages-in-forked-repo)

You just need to fork this project and insert your graphic assets and link your custom domain to the files here.
